To run this example you must setup a local web server so that the ajax requests will work.
Your URL should look something like:
http://localhost/advd3/map/map.html

Keep in mind it references advd3/d3.js etc
as well as advd3/map/data/enj_states_array.json

Geometry was added from: 
the us-states.json and us-state-centroids.json files from the d3.js data folder

Names, abbreviations, timezones and capitals were added from:
